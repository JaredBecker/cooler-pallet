## Colt Steele's Udemy React Course

here is the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/)

### I would not recommend this course

The course is extremely outdated and many of the ways he does things are not recommended by react anymore. A lot fo refactoring had to be done to get it to work.

### If you would like to check out the project, here's how you can do it😁

1. Download the Code as a .zip file, then extract into a folder
2. Open up a terminal, change directory into the folder you just extracted
3. Run `npm i`, after all dependencies have installed, run `npm start`
4. Enjoy!
